GENERAL

'rpass' is a module and related executable that are meant to make secure password management through the commandline accessible, convenient, and easy.

USAGE

NOTE: Passwords are never printed unless stated explicitly (see 'rpass -h')
SECURITY NOTE: It is highly recommended to have 'xclip' installed so that passwords never have to be written to stdout.

The command 'rpass' on its own will list account names and corresponding fields in the following format:

Account Name 1 - username1
Account Name 2 - username2
Account Name 3 <---------- There are no required fields in rpass apart from account name
...

The command 'rpass' followed by any text will print any accounts that contain the text in the account name, case-insensitive (regular expressions allowed) in the following format:

Account Name 1 - username1
Account Name 2 - username2
    optional_field1: optional_value1
Account Name 3
...

Additionally, the password of the first matching account will be copied to the X-clipboard if 'xclip' is in the user's $PATH.

The command 'rpass -a' brings up an interface to add accounts and information.
See rpass -h for more information.

After installation, the module can be imported with 'import rpass'. See the module source for more details.

DEPENDENCIES

The executable 'gpg' must be in your $PATH.

In order for copying to the X-clipboard to work, 'xclip' must be in the user's $PATH.
